# Dog Breed Classification System
This project aimed to develop a machine learning-based system for classifying dogs into various breeds. The system was trained on a dataset of dog images and was     designed to accurately identify the breed of a dog based on its appearance.

To better structure the project's lifetime, the project is produced using a Project Management Plan (PMP). To manage the project, several charting approaches such as Gantt Chart, Milestone Chart, and Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) are employed.

The PMP-Plan created is just a collaborative simulation between third-party organisations.

## Project Management Plan
##### Project Summary: [Project Summary](PMP-PLAN/A-PROJECT_SUMMARY.md)
Project Summary give a brief overview of the project objectives and team members details. 

##### Project Planning: [Project Planning](PMP-PLAN/B-PROJECT_PLANNING.md)
Planning processes include devising and maintaining a workable scheme to
ensure that the project addresses the organizationâ€™s needs. Gantt Chart, Work Breakdown Structure(WBS) is documented in this phase.

##### Project Implementation: [Project Implementaion](PMP-PLAN/C-PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION.md)
Project Implementation define the project deliverables which included software requirement, Intelligent system architecture and etc.

##### Project Execution: [Project Execution](PMP-PLAN/D-PROJECT_EXECUTION.md)
Project Execution is the execution phase where the result, coding blocks and technical implementation is defined and documented.

##### Project Closing: [Project Closing](PMP-PLAN/E-PROJECT_CLOSING.md)
Project Closing indicate the end of the project lifecycle where the project need to document closing document and lesson learnt report.
