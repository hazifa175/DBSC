# Dog Breed Classification System
This project aimed to develop a machine learning-based system for classifying dogs into various breeds. The system was trained on a dataset of dog images and was     designed to accurately identify the breed of a dog based on its appearance.

To better structure the project's lifetime, the project is produced using a Project Management Plan (PMP). To manage the project, several charting approaches such as Gantt Chart, Milestone Chart, and Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) are employed.

The PMP-Plan created is just a collaborative simulation between third-party organisations.
