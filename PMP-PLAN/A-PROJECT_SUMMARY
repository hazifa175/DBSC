# PROJECT OVERVIEW

## DEFINING THE PROJECT

### PROJECT SUMMARY

A dog breed classification system is a machine learning based system that classifies dog breeds based on visual characteristics. 
The system uses image processing and computer vision techniques to analyze images of dogs and predict the breed. 
The main component of the system is the machine learning model which can be trained with techniques such as deep learning and convolutional neural networks. T
o build the system, a dataset of labeled dog images is needed. The accuracy of the system heavily relies on the dataset size and quality, 
as well as the algorithm used for training the model. Building such a system is a challenging task that requires expertise in image processing,
machine learning and deep learning. The system has a wide range of applications such as animal rescue, veterinary medicine, pet ownership, and genetic research.
