# Recognition Model

The recognition model is trained with Dog Breed Idetification Dataset obtained from Kaggle.
The model extract dog image features using Inceptionv3 and trained with Deep Neural Network.
The source code for the recognition model is provided in the .ipnyb file.
You can try run the .ipnyb file using Google Colab that have a GPU setup.
Google Drive which contains the Dog Breed Identification Dataset is mounted in Google Colab. 

Warning: Make sure u have installed all the required libraries and functions as stated in the source code.
